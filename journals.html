        <p><strong>Reading 1: Laurenl Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House...</strong><br>This reading made some interesting pooints that I had thought about before even taking this course. I have considered in the past the difference between browsing the web back when I was a kid compared go now. I've thought about how the internet ot me is mostly just Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube, or Reddit lately. Sometimes Tumblr. Some others use Twitter. All can be accessed on apps optimized for mobile use already, so why even get on a computer most of the time? When I was a kid, I remember browsing the web with my friend. We would play small flash games, browse blogs and early meme sites, watch videos, etc. The internet felt so big, but now even though it is bigger than ever it feels very small due to the domination of social media.<br><br><br><strong>Reading 2: Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology</strong><br>I found this to be an interesting perspective I had not considered before. I do wonder sometimes how mundane things are made, I cannot make them either. I still never consdiered a plastic ballpoint pen to be a form of technology even though I don't know how to make one with my own hands. We have become to accustomed to having every little thing we need at our fingertips, we forget that those little things were once hi-tech.<br><br><br><strong>Reading 3: J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</strong><br>I originally the term "handmade web" to be an interesting concept at the beginning of this class. I only really think about handmade things in terms of traditional media or crafts. I never considered anything digital to really be handmade (aside from digital illustration, that is). I knew people would make websites themselves, coding without software doing it for them, but was that considered handmade? I didn't really understand until I started coding and making websites myself. It is a craft in and of itself, and feels the same as sculpting in a way. It does feel like I am creating something entirely handmade. I also liked the point that originally the web was meant for individuals to have online identities created through their own websites, instead of a select few large platforms hosting the online identities of individuals. It honestly makes me sad to think about what could have been. When I consider making my own website, I think, who is going to visit? I will never get as much traffic as I would on Instagram, for example. It just isn't how the internet is used nowadays. Imagining a world where instead of Instagram pages we all had our own completely custom websites where we had free reign is sort of melancholic to me. I would like to have my own website for my art, for people to commission me for paintings and for me to sell my paintings and for me to display my portfolio and even an everyday blog to display my life the way we do on Instagram, but no one would care to visit because we do have Instagram. Maybe people want everything to be at their fingertips so they can click away to another profile the moment they get bored. I suppose I am guilty as well.<br><br><br><strong>Reading 4: Taeyoon Choi, Hello World!</strong><br>One point I found interesting was the idea of commodifying computers so much society generally doesn't even know how they work, or doesn't think about it. When I was young, computers were a special thing. We werent on them all the time and we did not have access to them 24/7. Granted, I was a child so I would really only use them for playing games. Even as a teenager when I got my first smartphone I was not on a computer nearly as often as I am now (I am including phones as computers). Computers are so ingrained in our lives now that no one considers the inner workings.<br><br><br><strong>Reading 5: Callum Copley, A Friend is Writing</strong><br></p>
