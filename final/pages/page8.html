        <div class="textbox"><p class="special2"><em>Lockheart</em></p><p class="special">This somewhat thin vine only grows very deep within caves. It is fairly common, but extremely difficult to get to. it grows all along the walls of the cave, clinging to anything it can. It is found so deep that it is always the only plant around the area. These plants live for 50 years and take 5 years to mature. <br><br> The stems of this vine are a light pink and the leaves are a vibrant red. The leaves are heart-shaped and the size of one's palm. The stems are only about half an inch to one inch in diameter.<br><br> These vines are highly coveted. People venture into caves to harvest them in order to make wooden rings and bracelets for their lover.  The second name of this vine, "The Pink Death", comes from how difficult it is to get to these highly coveted vines and leave the cave with them. People often die trying. To aquire these vines and get out of the cave alive is considered an ultimate act of bravery, strength, and love.<br><br><a href="pageplhr.html">Lockheart rings</a><br><a href="../index.html">Home</a></p></div>
